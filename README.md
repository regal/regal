## Introduction

The **Regal Game Library** is the official TypeScript library used by games on the [**Regal Framework**](https://github.com/regal/about), a project designed to help developers bring text-driven games and story experiences to players in exciting new ways. 



## Status

Version `0.3.0` marks the first testable release of the library, but the package is still in early development.

The upcoming version `0.4.0` will have significant changes. It's recommended that you don't use the library until the first stable version `1.0.0` is released.
