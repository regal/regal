## Introduction

The **Regal Game Library** is the official TypeScript library used by games on the [**Regal Framework**](https://github.com/regal/about), a project designed to help developers bring text-driven games and story experiences to players in exciting new ways. 

## Status

The library is currently at version `0.6.0`, and is considered pre-stable release. In other words, big things might change.

While you're welcome to help test the early versions, it's recommended that you don't use the library for any major projects until `1.0.0` is released.
