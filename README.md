## Introduction

The **Regal Game Library** is the official TypeScript library for the [**Regal Framework**](https://github.com/regal/about), a project designed to help developers bring text-driven games and story experiences to players in exciting new ways.

### What is the Regal Framework?

The **Regal Framework** is a set of tools for developers to create text-driven games, sometimes called [Interactive Fiction (IF)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interactive_fiction), as highly portable bundles.

For more information, check out the project's [about](https://github.com/regal/about) page.

### How is the Regal Game Library Used?

The **Regal Game Library**, often referred to as the *Game Library* or its package name `regal`, is the JavaScript library that game developers use to create games for the Regal Framework. It was designed with first-class support for [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), but doesn't require it.

When a game is created using the Regal Game Library, it can be played by any Regal client automatically.

### What's the point?

Similar to Java's *"write once, run anywhere"* mantra, the goal of the **Regal Framework** is to produce games that can be played on all kinds of platforms without needing to rewrite any code.

The name _Regal_ is an acronym for **Re**inventing **G**ameplay through **A**udio and **L**anguage. The project was inspired by the idea of playing adventure games on smart voice assistants, but it doesn't have to stop there. Chatrooms, consoles, smart fridges...they're all within reach!
