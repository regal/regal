# Documentation

Regal documentation is divided into three sections: **overview**, **reference**, and **specification**.

## Definitions

**Overview** documents are designed for consumers of the library and are meant to introduce developers to most of the concepts of Regal, at a high level. These documents are not necessarily tied to a specific version of the library, and they are updated as needed. They often refer the reader to reference pages for more information.

**Reference** documents are designed for consumers of the library and are meant to be a complete reference of every user-facing feature. The complete library reference is considered a contract, and should be versioned appropriately.

**Specification** documents are designed for developers of the library and are meant to be a complete specification of every aspect of Regal. There may be some overlap in the information between the reference documentation and the specification, but they are written very differently. The Regal specification is considered a strict contract, and must be versioned appropriately.
