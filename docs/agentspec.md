# Agent Spec

## Requirements
1. All agent state must be kept within the scope of the GameInstance and it's EventFunction chain. Thus, there shall be no side effects to any objects in the global scope.
2. Changes to agent state are tracked within the GameInstance, along with the EventFunction in which they occurred, recorded as a series of commands that can be reversed.
3. The GameInstance state shall contain only the properties of agents that have changed from their original values. For example: if there is a complex Agent prefab with many properties, but only one of such properties is changed by the GameInstance, then only that property with its new value shall be stored in the GameInstance's state.
4. A reference to an Agent within an EventFunction shall first check the GameInstance's state for a modified property value before referring to the prefab. If a modified property exists, it shall be used instead of the prefab's property. This calculation shall be entirely hidden from the user.


## Code Example: Prefabs

### Agent class
```ts
class Agent {
    constructor(public name: string, public description: string) {}
    get uid() : number { /* ... */ }
    prefab() : this { /* ... */ }
    register(game: GameInstance) : this { /* ... */ }
}
```

### Example user-defined Agent subclass
```ts
class Dummy extends Agent {
    constructor(name: string, description: string, public health: number) {
        super(name, description);
    }
}
```

### Creating a Prefab is simple instantiation
```ts
const lars = new Dummy('Lars', 'The coolest man.', 50).prefab(); // Type is still Dummy
```

### Attempting to access a Prefab's properties directly causes an error
```ts
const desc = lars.description; // throws RegalError
lars.health += 5; // throws RegalError
```

### However, EventFunctions can be written using the Prefab as regular objects
```ts
const heal = (target: Dummy, amount: number) => 
    event("HEAL", game => {
        target.health += amount;
        game.output.write(`Healed ${target.name} by ${amount}, Health is now ${target.health}.`);
        return game;
});
```

### Register a Prefab with the GameInstance in order to use it
```ts
const start = () =>
    event("START", game => {
        const myLars = lars.register(game); // Type is still Dummy
        return heal(myLars, 10) (game);
});

const game = new GameInstance();
start() (game);
game === {
    events: [ 
        { 
            "HEAL" : [
                {
                    target: 1, // Lars prefab uid, which is autogenerated
                    property: "health",
                    action: "changed"
                    startValue: 50,
                    endValue: 60
                }
            ] 
        } 
    ],
    output: [ "Healed Lars by 10. Health is now 60." ],
    state: {
        1 : {
            health: 60
        }
    }
}
```
